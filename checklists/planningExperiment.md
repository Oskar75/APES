1. You know what you want to find out? Just to make sure - write it down!

2. Read up about [validity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Validity_%28statistics%29). Do you have a valid question? 

3. Read the hub on experimental design, and the chapter on the same topic [here](https://github.com/florianhartig/ResearchSkills/raw/master/Labs/Statistics/Script/EssentialStatistics.pdf)

4. Decide about the exact question and the experimental design. Write it down.

5. Play through the processes of collecting your data: simulate it through in your mind or in R, make up some data, write it down. Everything seems OK?

6. Play through the process of analysing your data. Can you answer your original question? Do a power analysis!

7. Based on 5/6 revise 4 if nececssary

8. Write down final approach
