Checklist for planning an experiment or a field study
===


1. You know what you want to find out? Just to make sure - write it down!

2. Read up about [validity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Validity_%28statistics%29). Do you have a valid question? 

3. Read the chapter about experimental design [here](https://github.com/florianhartig/ResearchSkills/raw/master/Labs/R/Script/Crashcourse-StatisticsWithR.pdf)

4. Decide about the exact question and the experimental design

5. Play through the processes of collecting your data, simulate it through, make up some data, write it down. Everything seems OK?

6. Play through the process of analysing your data. Can you answer your original question? Do a power analysis!

7. Based on 5/6 revise 4 if nececssary

8. Write down final approach

## Power analysis

As an example, see [session 4](https://github.com/biometry/APES/tree/master/LectureNotes/MixedEffectModels/Session4) of our mixed model lecture series, at the very end.
