Advice for Problems in Environmental Statistics

The goal of this work in progress is to provide a central website for students and other researchers seeking statistical advice 

* An overview about the standard topics and methods in (environmental) statistics with basic explanation and recommendations for further reading, suitable for any audience
* "Entry points" with short explanations and links for particular situations such as "I am planning my first experiment, what do I have to consider", "I want to start using R", "my script crashes and I don't know why"
* Basic help for R
* FAQ section
* Links to best practice recommendations for particular tasks


For reporting problems, or provide comments and suggestions, please create a GitHub account and use the ticket system. If this is not possible at all, contact http://florianhartig.wordpress.com/
