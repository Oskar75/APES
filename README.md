This is the collection of **Advice for Problems in Environmental Statistics (APES)** of the [Department of Biometry and Environmental System Analysis](http://www.biom.uni-freiburg.de/), University of Freiburg. 

Our aim is to provide a central website for students and researchers seeking statistical advice, including

* [An overview of the standard topics in statistics](http://biometry.github.io/APES/Stats/)
* [An introduction and help on the statistical programming language R](http://biometry.github.io/APES/R/)
* ["Hubs" on special topics](http://biometry.github.io/APES/Hubs/)
* ["Checklists" for particular situations](http://biometry.github.io/APES/Checklists/)

While the stats and r sites should be comprehensive, the hubs and checklists are supposed to be "guidebooks" on what is relevant regarding a particular topic (e.g. [hub on fitting process-based models](http://biometry.github.io/APES/Hubs/hub-fittingProcessBasedModels.html), and on what to do in a particular situation  (e.g. [Checklist on which analysis to choose](http://biometry.github.io/APES/checklists/whichAnalysis.html).

As of today, most of our pages are still empty, but feel free to check out the content provided by clicking on the links above. A few pages that may be of interest and that are already been filled with some content include 

* [Getting started with R](http://biometry.github.io/APES/R/R10-gettingStarted.html)
* [Analyzing data](http://biometry.github.io/APES/checklists/analysingData.html)
*	[What do do if you get an error from R](http://biometry.github.io/APES/R/R80-solvingProblems.html)
*	[Plotting with R](http://biometry.github.io/APES/R/R40-plottingInR.html)
