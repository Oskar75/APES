Advice for Problems in Environmental Statistics (APES)
====

Collection of stats knowledge of the department of Biometry and Environmental System Analysis, University of Freiburg.

The web version at http://florianhartig.github.io/APES/

THIS IS WORK IN PROGRESS, NOT FOR USE YET. The aim is to provide a central website for students and other researchers seeking statistical advice. We will provide 

* An overview about the standard topics and methods in (environmental) statistics with basic explanation and recommendations for further reading, suitable for any audience
* "Entry points" with short explanations and links for particular situations such as "I am planning my first experiment, what do I have to consider", "I want to start using R", "my script crashes and I don't know why"
* Basic help for R
* FAQ section
* Links to best practice recommendations for particular tasks


## What do you want to do

*NOTE: this is the provisional content of the start page. We list this here to work on it. A full table of contents is provided further below*

Choose between the following options:


### I want to see all you have on

* statistical topics
* using R

### I have one of the common problems 

* Improving stats and R knowledge in general
  * I never had statistics and don't know where to start
  * Want to learn how to work with R

* Taking and analyzing empirical data
  *	have to plan an experiment for a diploma thesis
  *	have data and want to get it into R
  *	have my data in R and wondering what to do with it

* Have a technical R problem
  *	get and error message and donâ€™t know that to do

* Am interested in a special topic (link to hubs)
