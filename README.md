This is the collection of **Advice for Problems in Environmental Statistics (APES)** of the [Department of Biometry and Environmental System Analysis](http://www.biom.uni-freiburg.de/), University of Freiburg. This website gives some basic intros and links for

* [Standard topics in statistics](http://biometry.github.io/APES/Stats/)
* [The statistical programming language R](http://biometry.github.io/APES/R/)

We also provide some ["Hubs" on special topics](http://biometry.github.io/APES/Hubs/) and ["Checklists" for particular situations](http://biometry.github.io/APES/Checklists/). If you are a student looking for help, the following pages may be particularly interesting: 

* [Getting started with R](http://biometry.github.io/APES/R/R10-gettingStarted.html)
*	[What do do if you get an error from R](http://biometry.github.io/APES/R/R80-solvingProblems.html)
	
* [Checklist planning an experiment](http://biometry.github.io/APES/checklists/planningExperiment.html)
* [Checklist analyzing data](http://biometry.github.io/APES/checklists/analysingData.html)
