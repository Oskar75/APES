Advice for Problems in Environmental Statistics (APES)
====

This is the collection of stats knowledge of the [Department of Biometry and Environmental System Analysis](http://www.biom.uni-freiburg.de/), University of Freiburg. 

Our aim is to provide a central website for students and researchers seeking statistical advice, including

* [An overview of the standard topics in statistics](https://github.com/biometry/APES/tree/master/Stats)
* [An introduction and help on the statistical programming language R](https://github.com/biometry/APES/tree/master/R)
* ["Hubs" on special topics](https://github.com/biometry/APES/tree/master/Hubs)
* ["Checklists" for particular situations](https://github.com/biometry/APES/blob/master/Checklists)

While the stats and r sites should be comprehensive, the hubs and checklists are supposed to be "guidebooks" on what is relevant regarding a particular topic (e.g. [hub on fitting process-based models](https://github.com/biometry/APES/blob/master/Hubs/hub-fittingProcessBasedModels.md), and on what to do in a particular situation  (e.g. [Checklist on which analysis to choose](https://github.com/biometry/APES/blob/master/Checklists/whichAnalysis.md).

As of today, most of our pages are still empty, but feel free to check out the content provided by clicking on the links above. A few pages that may be of interest and that are already been filled with some content include 

* [Getting started with R](https://github.com/biometry/APES/blob/master/R/R10-gettingStarted.md)
* [Analyzing data](https://github.com/biometry/APES/blob/master/checklists/analysingData.md)
*	[What do do if you get an error from R](https://github.com/biometry/APES/blob/master/R/R80-Problems.md)
*	[Plotting with R](https://github.com/biometry/APES/blob/master/R/R40-plottingInR.md)
