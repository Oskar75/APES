Advice for Problems in Environmental Statistics (APES)
====

This is the collection of stats knowledge of the [Department of Biometry and Environmental System Analysis](http://www.biom.uni-freiburg.de/), University of Freiburg. 

Our aim is to provide a central website for students and researchers seeking statistical advice, including

* [An overview of the standard topics in statistics](/Stats)
* [An introduction and help on the statistical programming language R](/R)
* ["Hubs" on special topics](/Hubs)
* ["Checklists" for particular situations](/Checklists)

While the stats and r sites should be comprehensive, the hubs and checklists are supposed to be "guidebooks" on what is relevant regarding a particular topic (e.g. [hub on fitting process-based models](/Hubs/hub-fittingProcessBasedModels.md), and on what to do in a particular situation  (e.g. [Checklist on which analysis to choose](/Checklists/whichAnalysis.md).

As of today, most of our pages are still empty, but feel free to check out the content provided by clicking on the links above. A few pages that may be of interest and that are already been filled with some content include 

* [Getting started with R](/R/R10-gettingStarted.md)
* [Analyzing data](/checklists/analysingData.md)
*	[What do do if you get an error from R](/R/R80-Problems.md)
*	[Plotting with R](/R/R40-PlottingWithR.md)
