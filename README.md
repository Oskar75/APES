Advice for Problems in Environmental Statistics (APES)
====

AT THE MOMENT, THIS IS WORK IN PROGRESS, NOT FOR USE YET. CONTRIBUTIONS AND SUGGESTIONS VERY WELCOME. IF YOU WANT TO CONTRIBUTE SEE https://github.com/florianhartig/APES/tree/master/Contribute. Get in touch with http://www.biom.uni-freiburg.de/mitarbeiter/hartig if you work on a longer text to avoid overlaps. Once we have the feeling that the content is more or less complete, a better looking web version of this document will be made available at http://biometry.github.io/APES/

This is the collection of stats knowledge of the [Department of Biometry and Environmental System Analysis](http://www.biom.uni-freiburg.de/), University of Freiburg. 

Our aim is to provide a central website for students and researchers seeking statistical advice, including

* [An overview of the standard topics in statistics](/Stats)
* [An introduction and help on the statistical programming language R](/R)
* ["Hubs" on special topics](/Hubs)
* ["Checklists" for particular situations](/checklists)

While the stats and r sites should be comprehensive, the hubs and checklists are supposed to be "guidebooks" on what is relevant regarding a particular topic (e.g. [hub on fitting process-based models](/Hubs/hub-fittingProcessBasedModels.md), and on what to do in a particular situation  (e.g. [Checklist on which analysis to choose](/checklists/whichAnalysis.md).

As of today, most of our pages are still empty. There are a few things that have already been filled with content and that could be used with care. Those include 

* [Getting started with R](/R/R10-gettingStarted.md)
*	[What do do if you get an error from R](/R/R60-Problems.md)
