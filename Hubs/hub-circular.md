Circular or directional statistics (see also [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directional_statistics)) is the subfield of statistics that deals with the analysis of directions, often angles. A typical example of such a question is the mean of an angular quantity (see [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_of_circular_quantities)).

Unfortunately, analysis options for circular data in R are limited. The following links may be a good start
