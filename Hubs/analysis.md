Analysis of data - a checklist
===

You have done your experiment or received data from other people. We hope you have followed our recommendations about how to plan an experiment, which means that you should know what youre questions is and how to analyze your data, but we don't assume that this is the case. 

Follow this checklist

## Start a new project

In RStudio or whatever editor you are using, created file structure, move raw data there.

We recommend putting your project under version control, but if you don't know that this is you can skip this for the moment

## Make sure you know your question

To make sure you really know that you want to find out, write it down at the beginning of your R script! This helps you, and us if we need to help you. Make sure you formulate a QUANTITATIVE hypothesis or question.

Good examples

* I want to find out whether the treatment has a higher value of X than the control. 

Bad examples

* I want to know what oak trees like
 
## Decide on statistical method

## Import and clean your data

* Import your data into R. See R help if you have problems
* Perform consistency checks, relabel, rename, reshape if neccesary
* NEVER change anything in your raw data file, all changes are made in the R script!

## Visualize your data / Explorative data analysis (optional)

It's good style to plot your data. Also, if you have no clear hypothesis, you may just do an explorative analysis and stop here. 

However, not good style is to change your hypothesis after viewing the data. If you have a specific hypothesis, it's good to still plot it before testing to make sure everything is all right, if you change the hypothesis you need to account for the fact that you already viewed your data. 

## Perform statistical analysis
