Recommendations what to teach and what you should know at different levels in your studies

Level 1: Statistics 101 (BSc)
1. Random variable, histograms, sample statistics (incl. median, IQR)
2. distributions: estimates vs. statistics
3. PDF, CDF; (mass function)
4. likelihood, maximum likelihood
5. correlation & X2-test 
6. GLM, regression
7. Design of experiments & hypothesis testing philosophy
8. ANOVA
9. transformations and ranking; problem of ratios and percentages
10. power (t-test, ANOVA)
11. PCA, recursive partitioning (for clustering)


Level 2: Applied and Advanced Statistics (MSc, PhD)
1. mixed models
2. zero-inflation
3. survival analysis (censored data, Cox-prop.hazard, Weibull-> Zucchini, GÖ)
4. randomisation, bootstrap
5. clustering (divisive, agglomerative), minimum spanning tree
6. ordination (PCA, nMDS; RDA, PCoA) and permutation tests
7. model selection, variance-bias trade-off, cross-validation
8. optimisation, non-linear models
9. CART, GAM
10. prospective power by simulation


Level 3: Specific statistical topics (as separate or combined modules)
1. Robust statistics & non-parametric statistics
2. WinBUGS
3. MCMC, from Metropolis to Gibbs & inverse modelling
4. multivariate statistics: old school (CA/DCA, CCA) & cutting edge (tests, bioenv, …)
5. time series analysis (detrending, autoregressive models, stl, spectral analysis, wavelets)
6. geo- and spatial statistics
7. ecological statistics (FD, SAR, richness, BDEF)
8. ecological modelling (ODE, diff eq)
9. scientific programming in R (for, if, vectorised, OOP, package building, docu)
