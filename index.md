Advice for Problems in Environmental Statistics (APES)
====

Collection of stats knowledge of the [Department of Biometry and Environmental System Analysis](http://www.biom.uni-freiburg.de/), University of Freiburg. The web version of this document will be pushed later to http://florianhartig.github.io/APES/

Our aim is to provide a central website for students and researchers seeking statistical advice. THIS IS WORK IN PROGRESS, NOT FOR USE YET. CONTRIBUTIONS AND SUGGESTIONS VERY WELCOME. IF YOU WANT TO CONTRIBUTE SEE https://github.com/florianhartig/APES/tree/master/Contribute. Get in touch with http://www.biom.uni-freiburg.de/mitarbeiter/hartig if you work on a longer text to avoid overlaps. 

We aim at providing

* An overview, short explanations and further links on all important topics of environmental statisitics and using R
* "Entry points" (hubs) for particular situations such as "I am planning my first experiment". "I want to start using R", "best practice for ..."

**Choose between the following options:**

*NOTE: this is the provisional content of the start page. We list this here to work on it. A full table of contents is provided further below*

### I want to see all you have on

* [statistical topics](/Stats)
* [using R](/R)

### I have one of the common problems 

* Improving stats and R knowledge in general
  * I never had statistics and don't know where to start
  * Want to learn how to work with R

* Taking and analyzing empirical data
  *	have to plan an experiment for a diploma thesis
  *	have data and want to get it into R
  *	have my data in R and wondering what to do with it

* Have a technical R problem
  *	[get and error message and donâ€™t know that to do](/R/R60-Problems.md)

* Am interested in a special topic (link to hubs)
