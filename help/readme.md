#Getting started with markdown

We use markdown to write the text for this site. 

"Markdown is a plain text formatting syntax designed so that it can optionally be converted to HTML using a tool by the same name. Markdown is popularly used as format for readme files, or for writing messages in online discussion forums, or in text editors for the quick creation of rich text documents." ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown )

If you start working with markdown, you will see that it's extremely simple and very similar to wiki syntax you might be used to. Have a look at
