## Some examples in R

### Correlations tests

Correlation tests measure the relationship between variables. This relationship can goes from +1 to -1, where 0 means no relation. Some of the tests that we can use to estimate this relationship are the following:

-Pearson's correlation is a parametric measure of the linear association between 2 numeric variables (PARAMETRIC TEST)

-Spearman's rank correlation is a non-parametric measure of the monotonic association between 2 numeric variables (NON-PARAMETRIC TEST)

-Kendall's rank correlation is another non-parametric measure of the associtaion, based on concordance or discordance of x-y pairs (NON-PARAMETRIC TEST)

```{r}
attach(mtcars)  
plot(hp, wt, main="scatterplot",las=1, xlab ="gross horse power", ylab="Weight (lb/1000)")
```

Compute the three correlation coefficients
```{r}
cor(hp, wt, method="pearson")
cor(hp, wt) #Pearson is the default method; the order of variables is not important
cor(hp, wt, method="spearman")
cor(hp, wt, method="kendal")
```

Test the null hypothesis, that means that the correlation is 0 (there is no correlation)
```{r}
cor.test(hp, wt, method="pearson") #Pearson correlation test

cor.test(hp, wt, method="spearman")
#Spearmn is a non-parametric, thus it is not possible to get CIs. There is a error message because R cannot compute exact p values (the test is based on ranks, we have few cars with the same hp or wt).
#We can get rid off the warning letting R know that approximate values are fine
cor.test(hp, wt, method="spearman", exact=F) 

cor.test(hp, wt, method="kendal", exact=F) #same happens with Kendal correlation test
```

When we have non-parametric data and we do not know which correlation method to choose, as a rule of thumb, if the correlation looks non-linear, Kendall tau should be better than Spearman Rho.


#### Further handy functions for correlations

Plot all possible combinations with `pairs`
```{r}
pairs(mtcars)  # all possible pairwise plots
```

To make it simpler we select what we are interested
```{r}
names(mtcars)
pairs(mtcars[,c(1,4,6)]) # subsetting the categories we will use
```

Building a correlation matrix
```{r}
cor(mtcars)
cor(mtcars[,c(1,4,6)])

detach(mtcars)
```
