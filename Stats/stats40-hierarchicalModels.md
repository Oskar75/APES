Hierarchical statistical models
===

Hierarchical models, also called multi-level models, are models in which processes occur at different levels. The easiest way to imagine such models is by thinking of two or more coupled mathematical equations. Typical reasons to have hierarchical models is because we have a process described by a traditional regression, plus an observation model, because we cannot observe every outcome with equal probability. In this case, the two hierarchical levels are the regression and on top of that the observation model.
