Multivariate Statistics
===

Multivariate statistics in the strict sense are statistics with a *multivariate response*. The large variety of methods can be loosely grouped into methods that compute distances between the elements of the (multivariate) response Y and then relate this distance matrix to predictors (sometimes called "indirect ordination"). Or those methods that directly compare two matrices (raw data or distances). In either case, multivariate statistics make heavy use of linear algebra and permutations of data (for testing). Some basic knowledge of both methods is essential for understanding multivariate statistics.
