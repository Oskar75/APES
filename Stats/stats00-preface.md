# What are the goals of statistics / data analysis

Toolbox to help us finding out 

* If observations are solid evidence, or could arise by coincidence
* What parameters or hypotheses are most likely, and what the uncertainty is 

As with any complicated tool, you have to know how to use it. If you press the wrong buttons, you'll get the wrong result. 

# What are the problems?


Correlation is not causality, Explain validity, correlation != causal, reproducibility, common problems and tricks that lead to p-value inflation etc.

# Branches of statistics / data science


* Descriptive statistics is the branch of statistical methods that basically display data, but do not directly draw conclusions from the data.

* The counterpart of descriptive statistics would be inferential statistics, which is often further classified in parametric and non-parametric methods.

* A further branch of statistics that has become important recently are methods that concentrate on predictions, in particular the so-called machine-learning methods.
