Regression
===



y = F(a,x)

where y is called the response, x are called the predictors, a are the parameters to be optiomized, and F could be any probabilistic functional that allows writing down the likelihood 

p(y|a;x), where x is assumed to be fixed, and the parameters a are varied to find the parameters for which the model predicts the highest probability to observe the data. 


The most important models used in regression are

* The linear model

* The linear mixed model

* The generalized linear models

* The generalized linear mixed models
 
* Nonlinear regression
