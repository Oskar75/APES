Structural Equation Models (SEMs)
===

Structural equation models (SEM) are a special class of hierarchical models. Starting initially only as correlation summaries for normally distributed variables, SEMs have branched out substantially and are now a pretty broad array of methods and software.



## Terminology 

- exogenous variables is not influenced by other variables. Opposite is an endogenous variable
- a manifest variable is observed directly (also called indicator variable)
- a latent variable is not observed directly
- moderation - something like an interaction, i.e. that one variable incfluences the effect of two other variables on each other.
