look at true rejections P(H1/H1)now to understand the problem with Bonferroni Correction add a normal distribution with mean=2 and sd=1 to the plot


```{r}
curve(dnorm(x), -4, 4)
curve(dnorm(x, mean =2), -4, 4, add = T, col = "red")


hist(rnorm(10),add=T, freq = F, col = "#00990044", breaks = 10)
hist(rnorm(10,mean=2),add=T , freq = F, col = "#99000044", breaks = 10)
```


```{r}
randH1<-rep(NA, 10000)
for (i in 1:10000){
  randH1[i]<-t.test(rnorm(10),rnorm(10))$p.value
}
sum(randH1<0.05) / 10000
sum(randH1<0.00005) / 10000
```



lets calculate the pvalues for 100 tests for which the means of the distributions are different (H1 is TRUE)

```{r}
randH1<-NULL
for (i in 1:1000){
  randH1[i]<-t.test(rnorm(20),rnorm(20,mean = 2))$p.value
}
1- sum(randH1<0.05) / 1000
1- sum(randH1<0.00005) / 1000

```


very high rate of type II error (false negatives)!
