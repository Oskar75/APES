Exercise1
add a new column to the mtcars dataframe called fgear (column as a factor) assigning 'three' to 3, 'four' to 4, and 'five' to 5
(when you do that, remember to have mtcars not attached!)

Exercise2
create a count table for fgear and plot the barchart





Solutions
1)
detach(mtcars) #if still attached
mtcars$fgear = factor(mtcars$gear, levels = c(3, 4, 5), labels = c("three", "four", "five"))
attach(mtcars)

2)
count = table(fgear)
barplot(count)
