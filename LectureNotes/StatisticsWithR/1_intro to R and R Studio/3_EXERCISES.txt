Exercise 1

- use a logic statement to assign TRUE to carb < 2, and FALSE  to >= 2
- use a logic statement to assign 1 to cyl = 4, 0 to other cyl values
- use cbind to assign such logical values to our mtcars dataframe


Exercise 2

- use ifelse to assign values 1 to hp<110, value 2 to hp>=110 
(test is the name of the new column you create in mtcars)


Exercise 3
Revise all the tutorials from day 1 and day 2.
iris is a file like mtcars, it is loaded by default in R
?iris for more info on iris data.
You also have the column Species that is a factor. 
Make practice with the 'iris' dataframe and re-run all scripts / functions / plots we have ran so far. 


Solution:
1)
attach(mtcars)
carbless2 = carb < 2
cyl4 = as.numeric(cyl == 4)
newdata = cbind(mtcars, carbless2, cyl4)

2)
mtcars$test = ifelse(hp < 110, 1, 2)
# or the way around
mtcars$test = ifelse(hp >= 110, 2, 1)

detach(mtcars)
