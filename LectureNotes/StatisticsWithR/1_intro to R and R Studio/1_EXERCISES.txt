EXERCISE 1	
- Assign the value 333 to the object called TEST 
(using = and <-)


EXERCISE 2
- Create a vector z with the values 1,23,45,67,87,45


EXERCISE 3
- create a vector resulting from a sequence of numbers from 1 to 2222 by 0.1 (myvector is the name assigned to the vector)

- What's the value of the 100th number of the vector?

- What's the sum of 100th value with 1000th value?


EXERCISE 4
- Remove TEST from the workspace

EXERCISE 5
- create a matrix (rowwise, 2 rows) with the values log(2), log(4), log(6), sqrt(10), log(7), sqrt(1), 0, 3 
mymatrix is the name assigned to the matrix
- create an object that is equivalent to the element in row 2 and colunm 3 of mymatrix; myobject is the name assigned to the object
- what is the result of the vector z times myobject?









SOLUTIONS
1)
TEST = 300
TEST <- 300

2) 
z = c(1,23,45,67,87,45)

3)
myvector = seq(from = 1, to = 2222, by = 0.1)
myvector[100]
myvector[100] + myvector[1000]

4)
rm(TEST)

5)
mymatrix = matrix(c(log(2), log(4), log(6), sqrt(10), log(7), sqrt(1), 0, 3), nrow=2, byrow=TRUE)
myobject = mymatrix[2,3]
z * myobject
