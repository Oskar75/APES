You measure the number of deer crossing roads in the black forest. Actually, you have 15 random points located along different roads, you go there and count deer crossing at dawn from 4 am to 8 am. While you are there counting deer, you also measure traffic on these roads (number of cars per hour) and forest density along roads (number of trees per 100 meter of road).
