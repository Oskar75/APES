(1) you are thinking to run a linear model with cyl and wt as predictors, mpg as response. Are you allowed to do that? Y/N? Why?



(2) run a regression with x = wt, y = mpg. Plot predictions with 95% CIs (library effects not allowed here).




(3) Are the assumptions of the model met?



(4) if your answer to question 3 is yes, we are good here.

(5) if your answer to question 3 is no, do something to improve the model fit and better meet the assumptions. Whatever improvements you achieve, decribe it.
