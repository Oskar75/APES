(1) you are thinking to run a linear model with cyl and wt as predictors, mpg as response. Are you allowed to do that? Y/N? Why?

```{r}

```

(2) run a regression with x = wt, y = mpg. Plot predictions with 95% CIs (library effects not allowed here).

```{r}


```


(3) Are the assumptions of the model met?

```{r}

```

(4) if your answer to question 3 is yes, we are good here.

(5) if your answer to question 3 is no, do something to improve the model fit and better meet the assumptions. Whatever improvements you achieve, decribe it.

```{r}


```
