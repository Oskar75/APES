Data in R
===

Before we can work with data, we need to be able to read it in an represent it in R

## Reading in data

## Data structures

An overview and examples of the available data structures in R is here

Important data structures are

* Atomic variables (numeric, char)
* Vectors (a sequence of atomic variables. For example c(1,2,3,4) is a vector of 4 numeric variables)
* Lists (like a vector, but unordered)
* A data frame (technically a list of vectors, untechnically think of it as a spreadsheat with collumns that can be of different atomic type)

Hint: you can find out the type and structure of an object in R with the class() and str() command

### Working with and manipulating data frames

The data frame is the most common choice to represent your field data, thefore it's important to know how to work with them and select data from them.
