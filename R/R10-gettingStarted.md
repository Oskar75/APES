Getting started with R
===

**Synopsis:** R is the most widely used software for statistical calculations. This explains how to get started with using R.

# R Software

If you are starting wit R, you need to install

 * The R software (http://www.r-project.org/)
 * Optional, but recommended, an editor. 
  * For beginners, we strongly recommend RStudio (https://www.rstudio.com/)
  * An alternative, specially if you're familiar with eclipse, is the statET plugin for eclipse (http://www.walware.de/goto/statet)

Both is available for free on all major platforms.

# R Tutorials for beginners

The following links are tutorials on using R as a language. They are helpful if you understand which statistical tests or analyses you want to do, and you just want to learn how to do it in R. They do typically NOT replace a proper statistics book that explains to you in detail why we do a regression, and whhat the assumptions are. If this is what you want to know, go to our stats section.

## Recommended free tutorials

* [Introduction to R](http://www3.nd.edu/~mclark19/learn/Introduction_to_R.pdf), by Michael Clark. Recommendation as a basic text for beginners.  
* [R for Beginners](http://cran.r-project.org/doc/contrib/Paradis-rdebuts_en.pdf), by Emmanuel Paradis. A bit more comprehensive than the reference above. Also highly recommended. 

## Other shorter intros

* [A (very) short introduction to R](http://cran.r-project.org/doc/contrib/Torfs+Brauer-Short-R-Intro.pdf), by Paul Torfs & Claudia Brauer, very compact
* [An R reference card](http://cran.r-project.org/doc/contrib/Baggott-refcard-v2.pdf), by Matt Baggott
* [An introduction to R](http://cran.r-project.org/doc/contrib/Lam-IntroductionToR_LHL.pdf), by Longhow Lam. Longer and more comprehensive than the other tutorials linked here.
