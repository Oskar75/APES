===

## I don't know how to do a certain thing

Go through the steps in desceniding order

1. Google it
2. Ask your colleauges / fellow students
3. Have a look at this website / FAQs, and the scripts and books we link to
4. If neither of this helps, To to "Places to get help from" below


## I have an error message that I can't resolve

First recommendation: Google it! If that doesn't help, kepp on reading.

### Understanding R error messages 

R triest to tell you what went wrong. Read the error message and think about that it could mean

### Reducing the problem to a minimal example

If that didn't help, reduce your problem to a minimal example.

For one thing, by doing this, you will actually find the problem. And secondly, it this is not the case, you can go with your minimal example to someone else to get help. 

## Places to get help from

You have ended up here because you couldn't resolve your problem. Hence, you have to ask for advice. You can do this by going to your supervisor, or posting a problem on the internet.

Be adviced that in either case, the people that you are asking for help are quite busy. They are not there to save you work that you could have done to make their job easier. Particularly on the internet, people can get very annoyed if you don't present your problem in the form that is most easy for them to address, i.e. as a minimal example (see above). Read, for example, http://www.r-project.org/posting-guide.html
